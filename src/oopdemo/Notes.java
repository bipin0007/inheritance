	 * There are 4 pillars of OOSP in java
	 * 1. Inheritance
	 * 2. Ploymorphism
	 * 3. Abstraction
	 * 4. Encapsulation
	 * 
	 * 1. Inhertiance:  Inheritance is an object orriented cconcept in this a child class(subclass)uses 
	 * the common property of parent class(super class).
	 * Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

	 * 
	 * Adv: By using inheritance the information becomes more managable and in hirechical form.
	 * 
	 * How to achieve: In other words we can say that an inheritance is relationship between super class and sub class.
Inheritance relationship is created by using keyword"extend"


      why use inheritance:
1. For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
2. For Code Reusability

Terms used in Inheritance:
1. Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. 
It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.

2. Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class which inherits the other class.
It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.

3.Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a 
subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.

4. Reusability: As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism 
which facilitates you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class 
when you create a new class. You can use the same fields and 
methods already defined in the previous class.

Syntax of inheritance is:
class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name  
{  
   //methods and fields  
}  

	 * 
	 * 
	 * Types of Inheritance:
	 * 1. Single
	 * 2. Multilevel
	 * 3. Hierarchical
	 * 4. Multiple: This type of inheritance can not be achieved in java at class level
